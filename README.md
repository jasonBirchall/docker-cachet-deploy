# MoJ Cachet Docker Image

This is the MoJ fork of the [official Cachet docker image](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Docker). It is branched off [upstream version 2.0](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Docker/tree/2.0)
and the version of Cachet updated. This is done to maintain a single container deployment, later upstream releases depend more heavily on docker-compose 
or elaborate volume sharing inconsistent with our current Docker versioning.

[Cachet](https://github.com/cachethq/Cachet) is a beautiful and powerful open source status page system, a free replacement to services such as StatusPage.io, Status.io and others.
